# 🐦 Flocking Simulation in Unity (Boids)

## 🎯 Overview

- 📌 Inspired by [Craig Reynolds' Boids algorithm](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)
- 🧠 Simulates natural flocking using three core rules:
  - **Separation**: avoid crowding neighbors
  - **Alignment**: steer towards the average heading of neighbors
  - **Cohesion**: move toward the average position of neighbors
- 🌐 Built in Unity with C#

## 🎮 Features

- Real-time simulation of autonomous agents
- Adjustable parameters:
  - Boid speed, view radius, separation weight, alignment weight, cohesion weight
- Visualization of agent direction and behavior
- Optional boundary confinement

## 🛠️ Controls

- **R** to randomise boid positions
- **left click** to make boids follow your mouse
- **right click** to push boids away from the mouse 

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download the project
2. Unzip the built files
3. Download *unityplayer.dll* file using [this](https://iosninja.io/dll/download/unityplayer-dll) link
4. Place the file into the folder
5. Open the .exe file
